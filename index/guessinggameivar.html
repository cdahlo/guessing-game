  <p><h4>Hi, I'm Ivar. I went to Western Washington University where I studied Political Science. I worked in Package Data Management at UPS for the past couple of years. I decided that I would like to try something new, so I signed up for this course hoping that I might find a new career after completing the associated course work.</h4>

  <p><h3><center>Here's what I think the JavaScript is doing...</center></h3>

  <h4><ul>

  <li>Prompts user for name, saves name as variable</li>

  <li>Prompts user for how they are feeling, saves feeling as variable</li>

  <li>Prompts user with a yes or no question, tells user whether they are correct or not</li>

  <li>Saves correct answers to a variable called 'score'</li>

  <li>Lets user know how many correct responses they got out of 3</li>

  </ul></h4>
